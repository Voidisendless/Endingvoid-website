      <h1>About This Website</h1>

      <p>
        This website was built in under 24 hours using plain
        <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
        It was created as part of my learning process and to showcase my progress
        as a developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        No external libraries or frameworks were used during development.
        Everything you see here was written by hand to help me better understand
        how websites work at a fundamental level.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re interested in how this site is structured or built, you can
        view the source code on my GitHub via the
        <a href="Projects.html">Projects</a> page.
