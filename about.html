            Built from scratch as a learning project using HTML, CSS, and

            This website was built in under 24 hours using plain
            <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
            <strong>JavaScript</strong>. It was created as part of my learning
            process and to showcase my progress as a developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            No external libraries or frameworks were used during development.
            Everything you see here was written by hand to help me better
            understand how websites work at a fundamental level.
          </p>
