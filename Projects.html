        <h2>Upcoming Projects and Plans</h2>
        <p>At the moment I don't have any projects i would like to get done or any specific application I would like to build.</p>
        <p>However, I am always open to suggestions! If you have any ideas for projects or applications that you think would be interesting or useful, please feel free to reach out to me through the contact section.</p>
        <p>I think my next step would to be building this website again using libraries for Javascript and CSS</p>
